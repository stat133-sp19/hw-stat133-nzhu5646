### Italian Stuffed Cabbage

![](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8483764953_535f914f2f_z.jpg)
Ingredients:

-   1 large savoy cabbage
-   7-ounce hunk of break, crusts cut away, torn into small scraps
-   2/3 cup whole milk
-   14 ounces or approximately 4 plain pork sausages, casing removed
-   1 small sprig of sage, finely chopped
-   1 small sprig of rosemary, finely chopped
-   2 tablespoons grated parmesan
-   salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
-   1 28-ounce can peeled plum tomatoes
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   1 clove garlic, peeled and minced

Kitchen Tools:

-   large pot
-   towels
-   large bowl
-   spoon and fork
-   toothpicks
-   knife
-   heavy saute pan

Steps:

1.  Boil a large pot of salted water

2.  Peel 12 nice, large leaves of cabbage

3.  Blanch leaves in water for about 30 seconds to one minute

4.  Spread cabbage leaves on towels so they can dry and cool

5.  For the filling mixture, place bread scraps in large bowl and pour milk over them

6.  Let them sit gently for a couple of minutes before mashing them with a spoon so that a paste forms

7.  Mix the mashed bread scraps with sausage meat, herbs, parmesan, and a pinch of salt and black pepper

8.  Lay cabbage leaf on counter and form some of the filling mixture into a golf ball-sized clump

9.  Wrap cabbage leaf around this clump and pin it with a toothpick

10. Repeat this for all the cabbage leaves

11. To make sauce, roughly chop tomatoes and cook them in a heavy saute pan with olive oil over medium heat

12. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds, before bringing sauce to a gentle boil

13. Add cabbage packages to the pan and let simmer for 25 minutes with the pan covered

14. Remove lid and let simmer for another 10 minutes

15. Turn off heat and let rest for 15 minutes before eating

Other Comments: This dish is pretty good to make in the winter. Many other variations of this recipe occur by changing the type of stuffing wrapped within the cabbage leaves. For example, the French *chou farci* stuffs the leaves with beef and porj while the Polish *gloabki* stuffs the leaves with pork, beef and rice or barley.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

#### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting ($\\mathbf{\\overline{pq}}$).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of he vector.

$\\lVert \\mathbf{p} \\rVert = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}})$,

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
